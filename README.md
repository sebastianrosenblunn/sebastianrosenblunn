Hello, I'm Sebastian Rosenblunn! 👋

A little bit about me...

Passionate about programming and psychology, I love how these two disciplines intertwine in the field of research! Currently, my professional goal is focused on Data Analytics, and I am fascinated by the emerging knowledge that arises from the application of statistical techniques and Machine Learning on data. 📊🔍

As a Junior Advance Data Analyst, I have experience in extracting, transforming, and loading data (ETL) using Python/R and data manipulation libraries. I also have skills in performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and generating relevant insights through graphs and statistical analysis, as well as creating dashboards in PowerBI/Tableau/Looker. I have considerable experience in creating and manipulating relational databases with SQL. Furthermore, I can implement relatively simple Machine Learning models and deploy them through services like FastAPI and Streamlit. 🚀📈 I also have experience in Google Cloud Platform services such as Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions, Bigquery, AppEngine, among others.

As a Psychology student, I am interested in learning and developing the most important skills for self-management and teamwork, as well as delving deeper into the procedures and theory that support research methodology. 🧠🔍

I am committed to continuous learning and am always open to new opportunities that allow me to grow both professionally and personally in this exciting field. I love challenges! 💪🔥
